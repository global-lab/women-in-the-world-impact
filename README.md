# Tree representation of the impact of Interactive Qualifying Projects on women around the world


This is an interactive visualization of the impact that the Women in the World (WIW) project has had on the community at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). WIW was funded by the Women's Impact Network at WPI. 


The visualization comes in the form of an interactive tree diagram, where the top level breaks down into smaller categories that the gathered IQPs fall under. As the user clicks one of these categories, a brief description appears and the subcategories of that category expand. The same interaction happens with the subcategories, except instead of a brief description the user gets presented with titles of the IQPs that fall under that sub-category. 


Clicking on these titles presents the user with a description of the project and a link to the respective paper.
